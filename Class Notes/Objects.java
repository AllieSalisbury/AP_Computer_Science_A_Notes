    So far in this class, we've really been focused on variables and methods.
    In particular, we've combined variables (data) and methods (functions, behaviors, actions)
    to build programs.

    We are going to move from "procedural decomposition", the idea of
    breaking big tasks into small ones done by methods, to object-oriented programming.

    /*
    Objects

    Objects are the combination of data (variables) and behavior (methods).
    They are both. 
    
    Other examples of entities made of multiple parts would be 
    things like how the government is made of three branches, or how many religions
    think that "man" is made of multiple parts like body, soul, spirit, etc.

    An example of an Object is a String. Strings have data (the text of the String)
    and also behaviors (methods) such as charAt() or length().

    For now, let's not worry about how to create our own Objects, but instead just
    think about why we use them and how to use them.

    /*
    Motivation

    For now, we've been working 

    Objects:
    Reduce complexity of programs
    Bundles data together with relevant methods
    Are always built for a specific task or goal
    Are re-useable
    "Abstract" away unnecessary details (things we don't want to worry about)
