    So far, we've focused on programming problems do something a specific number of times (usually once).
    However, today we are going to learn about a specific construct
    that lets us loop over a specific code segment as many times as we want.

    This construct is a "while loop", and it is going to save us a lot of time and typing.
    It's defined as follows:
    */

    /*
    while (<test>) {
    *statement*
    *statement*
    *statement*
    }
    */

    /*
    Notice that the way we define a while loop is very similar to an if statement.
    We have a test, and we have a segment of code that runs as long as the test is true. 
    It's appropriate to think of a while loop as an upgraded if statement, 
    that can run a segment of code as many times as necessary.
