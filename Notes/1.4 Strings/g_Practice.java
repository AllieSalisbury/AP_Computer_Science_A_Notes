    Working with a partner on a whiteboard, write some programs!

    Problem 0:
    Write a program that:
    1) Declares and initializes a String variable s.
    2) Finds the first and last characters in s and prints them out. 

    Problem 1:
    Write a program that:
    1) Declares and initializes a String variable s.
    2) Makes a substring t of s.
    3) Confirms that s contains t. 

    Problem 2:
    Write a program that: 
    1) Declares and initializes a String variable s storing: "First Last"
    to represent someone's legal name.
    2) Finds the index of the space 
    3) Splits s into two Strings, one for the first name, and one for the last.
