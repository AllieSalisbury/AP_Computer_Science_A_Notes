        We might imagine that a String s looks something like this.
                s
        -----------------
        |               |
        |     "hello"   |
        |               |
        -----------------

        However, this is a little too simplistic. Strings are actually
        represented as a list of individual characters.

            s
        -----   -----   -----   -----   -----
        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        | h |   | e |   | l |   | l |   | o |
        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        -----   -----   -----   -----   -----
          0       1       2       3       4

        Each character in your String has what we call an index.
        The index is the int that refers to the position of the character,
        and the index of the first character is 0.

        /*
        Q: What is the index of the last character of a String with 5 characters?
        6 characters?
        x characters? 
        */
    }
