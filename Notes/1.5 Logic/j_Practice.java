    Working with a partner on a whiteboard, write some programs!

    Problem 0:
    Write a program that:
    1) Generates a random double between 0 and 1.
    2) Uses the random double to simulate flipping a coin.
    3) Prints out whether the coin flip was heads or tails.

    Problem 1:
    Write a program that:
    1) Declares and initializes a String for someone's name
    2) Determines if their name starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u)
    3) If their name starts with a vowel, prints it out.
       Otherwise, prints out nothing!

    Hint: can we check if the first character is a vowel
    with only one comparison operator? 

    Problem 2:
    Mr. Gao needs a kidney... 

    Write a program that:
    0) Declares and initializes ints representing how many kidneys you have
    and how many Mr. Gao has
    1) Declares and initializes two booleans representing whether you:
    have two kidneys and are an organ donor
    2) If you have two kidneys AND are an organ donor,
    updates the number of kidney variables correctly
    (subtract one from you and give one to Mr. Gao)
