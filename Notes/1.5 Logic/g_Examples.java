/*
Let's work through some examples that put
everything together:

We need to know how to use:
- Comparison operators (==, >, etc)
- Logical operators (||, !, &&)
- Logical statements (5 > 4, s.contains(t))
- Conditional statements (if (b == true))

To write programs that operate "smartly". 
When I say smartly, I mean that these programs
can do different things based on the values
of existing variables!
