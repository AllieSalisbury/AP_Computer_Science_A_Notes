    Working with a partner on a whiteboard, write some programs!

    Problem 0:
    Write a program that:
    1) Generates a random double between 0 and 1.
    2) Uses the random double to simulate flipping a coin.
    3) Prints out whether the coin flip was heads or tails.

    Problem 1:
    Write a program that:
    1) Declares and initializes a String for someone's name
    2) Determines if their name starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u)
    3) If their name starts with a vowel, prints it out.
       Otherwise, prints out nothing!

    Hint: can we check if the first character is a vowel
    with only one comparison operator?
