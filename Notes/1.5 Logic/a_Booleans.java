public class a_Booleans

/*
So far, we've learned about:
0) ints
1) doubles
2) Strings
3) chars

which have let us store numerical and textual information.

But what about logical information? What if we want
to represent whether something is true or not?

Booleans are a data type that only have two values:
true and false.

We will use booleans for a few purposes, but one useful
way to think of booleans is that they're always the answer
to a yes or no question.
