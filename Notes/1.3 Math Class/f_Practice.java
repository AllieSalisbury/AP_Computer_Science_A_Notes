        Before we work on the lab, let's do some practice problems!
        Get some partners and a whiteboard, and try to solve these problems.

        PRACTICE PROBLEM 1:
        Write a program that:
        1) Declares and initializes an int variable for the radius of a circle
        2) Calculates the area of the circle (Area = π × radius²)  
        3) Prints out the area

        Hint: Math.PI isn't a method, but it's a variable that your computer can use
        without any additional declaration or initialization. 
        */

        System.out.println(Math.PI);

        /*
        PRACTICE PROBLEM 2:
        Write a program that:
        1) Generates a random integer from 1 to 6, inclusive. 
        2) Prints that integer out.

        */

        /*
        PRACTICE PROBLEM 3:
        Write a program that:
        1) Declares and initializes two integers representing the legs of a right triangle
        2) Calculates and prints the hypotenuse of the triangle. 
        */

        /*
        PRACTICE PROBLEM 4:
        Write a program that:
        1) Declares an initializes a double variable of your choice
        2) makes an int variable that represents the next largest integer

        If you want to check your answers, I recommend running the code by hand.
        You know what each command does, so you can be the computer.

        If you're stuck, I would encourage you to break the problem down into steps.
        What's one line of code you'll need for your program? What's another?
