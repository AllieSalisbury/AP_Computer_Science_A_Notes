/*
0) Review of PB&J Activity

- What instructions were ambiguous?
- What went well?
- How do you get good at explaining your thoughts to others? 
*/

/*
1) What is programming? 

Multiple Definitions:
- Process of writing computer programs
  - Giving a computer a list of instructions to execute
    - If you've followed a recipe or Google Maps before, you were the computer!  
- Teaching computers how to do something (writing algorithms)
- More than just coding
*/

/*
2) Thinking algorithmically

Algorithms
Definitions:
- step-by-step description of solving a problem
- How computers interpret things (literally, and in a step-by-step manner)

How and why to think algorithmically?
- Pragmatic since it produces a result (an algorithm) that a computer can understand
- Makes hard problems easier
- Kind of like mathematical proofs
  - We know the beginning and ending of the problem, we just need to figure out
    the steps in the middle 
*/

/*
3) "Hello, World!"

Go ahead and open the "Lab 0" assignment on the school website. 
We're going to write our first program together. 
*/

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
  }

/*
4) git commit

When you're done coding (or at a checkpoint), it's time to commit your changes
to a repository. 

Algorithm:

0) Go to the "Source Control" tab 
1) Write a concise message detailing what you've done 
2) Press "Commit"
3) Press Always
4) Press Sync changes
5) "Ok, don't show again"
