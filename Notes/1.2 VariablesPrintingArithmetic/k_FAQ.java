        Q: How do I save?
        A: Codespaces saves by default every once in a while. You still need to commit
        though. Otherwise I can't see your work! 

        Q: If I run my file once, will the variables be saved for next time?
        A: No, each time you run a file, your program starts as a blank slate

        Q: How do I check or troubleshoot my work?
        A: Run your code! Either on a computer or by hand.

        Q: Can I use operations I've learned in another computer science in this class?
        A: Not until we go over them in class.
        
        Q: What will problems on the quiz and test look like?
        A: They'll look a lot like the problems from the Notes or Labs. 

        Q: How do I comment or uncomment code from the Notes? I want to see the output.
        A: On Mac, you can highlight the code, then press Cmd + /. On Windows, it's
        Ctrl + /. This comments or uncomments entire blocks of code.
