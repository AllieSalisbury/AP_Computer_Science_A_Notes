        Variables and why they're useful

        Last class, we learned how to print things and run code
        As we move on to more complex programs, we're going to need a way to store information
        Imagine the following program that is going to add any two numbers 
        */
        System.out.println("--------------------");

        System.out.println(5 + 7);
      
        /*
        Q: What does this program do? 

        Q: How would we need to change it if we change the numbers? 

        For now, let's just worry about two types of variables
        that each correspond to different kinds of numbers.

        int: integers
        double: real numbers

        Variables have 3 parts: 
        1) type
        2) name
        3) value

            (1) (2) (3)
        Ex: int num = 37;

        To "make" a variable in Java, we must "declare" and "initialize" it

        declare: Tell Java you are making a certain type of variable with a certain name
        This is (1) and (2) on the above line of code.
        initialize: Give that variable you just declared an initial value
        This is (3) on the above code

        The equals sign "=" is used to initialize variables. It's often called the 
        assignment operator, since it assigns a value to a particular variable.

        Variables all need to have different names. We can't have two variables with the same name. 
        You can do other things with variables, we will see this later.
