        Let's do some practice.
        Find some partners and a whiteboard,
        and try to write a program that will: 
        
        1) Declare and initialize two integer variables
        2) divide them
        3) and print out the integer quotient and remainder.
        4) Print out the exact quotient.

        To get the exact quotient, we will need to convert one of the ints to a double.
        How do we do that?

        When you start working on the lab, you should continue working on whiteboards.
        It might seem unnecessary right now, but as programs get more complex,
        you'll want somewhere to put your thoughts besides inside your head.
